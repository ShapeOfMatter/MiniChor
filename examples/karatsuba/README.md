# Example: Karatsuba Fast Multiplication

## Overview

This example implements the three-way concurrent implementation of the Karatsuba fast multiplication algorithm shown in [Object-Oriented Choreographic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09520).

## Execution

The executable takes two integers as arguments and returns their product. It uses the local backend and distribute the computation over threads.

```bash
cabal run karatsuba 100 200
20000
```

`Reference.h` contains a single-threaded reference implementation of the algorithm.
