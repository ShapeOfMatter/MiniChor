# Example: Quicksort

## Overview

This example implements the three-way concurrent implementation of quicksort.

## Execution

This choreography will sort the list `[1, 6, 5, 3, 4, 2, 7, 8]`. It uses the local backend and distribute the computation over threads.

```bash
cabal run quicksort
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
```

`Reference.hs` contains a single-threaded reference implementation of the algorithm.
